This exercise involved using various methods to solve differential equations.

For example, I used the finite-difference representation and iterated using the Gauss-Seidel method to solve Laplace's equation in two dimensions. This was used to simulate the electric field for a parallel-plate capacitor.

I also used a similar method to solve the heat diffusion equation for a metal poker, plotting its temperature distribution as a function of time.
